# World Digital Clock

The World Digital Clock is a simple, interactive digital clock that displays the current time in various time zones around the world. Users can select a time zone and time format (24-hour or 12-hour) to view the local time and related details.

## Features

- Time zone selection: Choose from several time zones, including Local Time, UTC, PST, EST, and IST.
- Time format selection: Toggle between 24-hour and 12-hour time formats.
- Dynamic time zone description: Displays a brief description of the selected time zone.

## Getting Started

To use the World Digital Clock, clone this repository or download the files directly. The project consists of three main files:

1. `Digital_Clock.html` - The main HTML file that structures the web page.
2. `script.js` - Contains the JavaScript code to handle time zone conversions and clock updates.
3. `styles.css` - Defines the styling for the digital clock and its components.

### Prerequisites

No external libraries or tools are required. The project runs in any modern web browser.

### Running the Project

Open the `Digital_Clock.html` file in a web browser to start the clock. Select a time zone and format using the dropdown menus to see the current time and its details.

## How It Works

- The clock uses the `Date` object in JavaScript to obtain the current time and adjusts it based on the selected time zone.
- Event listeners are added to the dropdown menus to update the clock and time zone description whenever the user makes a selection.
- CSS is used to style the clock and page layout for a user-friendly interface.
